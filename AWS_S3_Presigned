Here's an example of how you can give a vendor temporary access to your S3 bucket to check logs, using pre-signed URLs, which are simple and secure:

### Example: Generating a Pre-Signed URL for Temporary Access

Suppose you want the vendor to access a specific log file in your S3 bucket for a limited time, say 2 hours.

**Using AWS CLI**:
```bash
aws s3 presign s3://your-bucket-name/path/to/logfile.log --expires-in 7200
```
This command generates a URL valid for 7200 seconds (2 hours). The vendor can use this link to download the log file without needing AWS permissions permanently.

**Using AWS SDK (Python example with Boto3)**:
```python
import boto3

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
url = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
    ClientMethod='get_object',
    Params={'Bucket': 'your-bucket-name', 'Key': 'path/to/logfile.log'},
    ExpiresIn=7200  # 2 hours
)

print(url)
```
You can send this URL to the vendor, and after 2 hours, it will expire, ensuring controlled, limited access.

### Summary
- Generate pre-signed URLs for specific objects in your bucket.
- Set an expiration time based on your requirements.
- Share the URL securely with the vendor.
- After expiration, the URL becomes invalid automatically.

This method offers a straightforward, secure way to provide temporary access without modifying bucket policies or creating IAM roles for the vendor[6][8].

Yes, presigned URLs in AWS S3 do have an expiration time that is set when they are created, and the expiration is strictly enforced based on time.

- When creating a presigned URL, you specify a duration for which the URL should remain valid, from as little as 1 second up to a maximum of 7 days (604800 seconds) if using AWS CLI or SDKs. If created via AWS Console, the limit is typically up to 12 hours[1][6].
- Importantly, if the presigned URL is generated with temporary credentials (such as assuming an IAM role using STS), the URL can expire earlier than the configured expiration time because it also depends on the validity period of the underlying temporary credentials themselves. The shortest of these expiration times applies[1][3][4].
- For example, if your temporary STS token expires in 1 hour but you generate a presigned URL with 2 hours expiry, the URL will expire after 1 hour when the token expires.
- During the valid period, the URL can be used multiple times. If a download starts before expiration but continues past it, the operation will still succeed[1].
- If you want very long-term access beyond 7 days, presigned URLs alone cannot support that; alternative methods like CloudFront signed URLs should be used[3].

So yes, presigned URLs are time-based and the expiration time works in conjunction with any time constraints from the credentials used to create them[1][3][4].

This means presigned URLs and their time-based expirations work together to securely and temporarily grant access to S3 objects.

Terraform itself does not natively create presigned URLs for S3 objects since it is an infrastructure-as-code tool; presigned URLs are intended for runtime use. However, you can integrate presigned URL creation by combining Terraform's resource provisioning with local or external scripts that generate the URLs after your resources are created[1][4].

### Example: Terraform with Local-Exec Provisioner

Here is a Terraform code snippet that shows how to create an S3 bucket, upload an object, and generate a presigned URL using a local-exec provisioner (which will run an AWS CLI command after resource creation):

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
  bucket = "my-logs-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "logfile" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.logs.id
  key    = "sample-log.txt"
  content = "Sample log content"
}

resource "null_resource" "presigned_url" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws s3 presign s3://${aws_s3_bucket.logs.id}/${aws_s3_bucket_object.logfile.key} --expires-in 3600 > presigned_url.txt"
  }
}

data "local_file" "presigned_url" {
  depends_on = [null_resource.presigned_url]
  filename   = "${path.module}/presigned_url.txt"
}

output "presigned_logfile_url" {
  value = data.local_file.presigned_url.content
}
```
- This example creates an S3 bucket and object, then runs the AWS CLI to create a presigned URL that expires in 1 hour, saving it to a file and outputting it[1].

### Alternative: External Data Source

You can also use Terraform's external data source to call a shell script, Python, or other code to create a presigned URL and return it to Terraform for use in other resources[1].

```hcl
data "external" "presign" {
  program = ["bash", "${path.module}/presign.sh"]
  query = {
    bucket = "my-logs-bucket"
    key    = "sample-log.txt"
    expires_in = 3600
  }
}

output "presigned_url" {
  value = data.external.presign.result.url
}
```
The `presign.sh` script would generate the presigned URL using AWS CLI or SDK.

### Key Points

- Terraform does most of the resource provisioning.
- Presigned URLs are created post-deployment using local-exec or external scripts.
- You can control the time-based expiry and automate the process as part of your infrastructure workflow[1][4].
- Modules such as `terra3/aws` provide patterns, but native support for presigned URLs is limited; scripting is the standard solution.

This way, you can automate the infrastructure and the generation of presigned, time-limited S3 URLs together using Terraform[1][4].
